    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>In Kenya, matumbo (tripe) is very affordable and it is actually really delicious if done well. 
        Matumbo wet fry is often served with Ugali. My recipe requires you to boil the matumbo for 3-4 hours or until tender, 
        but if you are in a hurry, you can use a pressure cooker and that will take you less than half an hour.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>500gms matumbo(tripe), cleaned thoroughly and chopped into pieces</li>
        <li>2 tbsp ginger-garlic, minced + 1 tsp</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>2 tbsp oil</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1/4 cup coriander stems, chopped</li>
        <li>3/4 cup tomatoes, crushed</li>
        <li>1 tsp tomato paste</li>
        <li>Coriander leaves for garnishing</li>
    </ul>

    <p>For the Ugali:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups water</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups maize flour</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>To boil the matumbo: Boil water in a heavy bottomed pot. 
            Once the water comes to a boil, add matumbo pieces, ginger, garlic and salt. 
            Boil for 3-4 hours or until the tripe is tender.</li>
        <li>In a pan, heat oil. Add onions and cook until translucent. 
            Add ginger, garlic and coriander stems and stir for 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Add tomatoes, tomato paste, matumbo pieces and salt and stir. Cook for 8-10 minutes. 
            Garnish with coriander leaves and serve with Ugali.</li>
        <li>For the Ugali: Bring the water to boil in a pot/sufuria. Add 1/2 cup maize meal to the boiling water. 
            Adding a little bit of the meal to the water ensures that the water starts to roar which makes the perfect ugali. 
            Stir using a wooden spatula and try to break any lumps apart.</li>
        <li>Add the remaining flour and get stirring. Using the spatula, smoothen out any lumps that may have formed. 
            If the ugali is not hard enough, add more flour. Lower the heat and keep working the ugali against the sides of the pot, 
            getting rid of any lumps and also making sure it is evenly cooked.</li>
        <li>Once cooked, mould it using the spatula and serve with the Matumbo wet fry.</li>
    </ol>
