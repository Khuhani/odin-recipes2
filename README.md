# odin-recipes2

This is a 100% HTML project. The goal is to test/reinforce my HTML skills so far
by building a website on my favorite recipes. 

The website will not have any styling or interactivity whatsoever - for now. 

This project will demonstrate my ability to use git, set up an HTML BoilerPlate, and add links, images and text correctly.
